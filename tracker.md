## Next Step
Have Crystal test the updated calculator to confirm formulas now match what her team uses.

## Lessons Learned
- **Research currency matters**: Initial research found widely-cited IOM 2002 formulas, but Health Canada has since updated to 2023 equations. Always check for the NEWEST version of reference materials, not just the most common/cited ones.
