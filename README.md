## Formula Sources

### Energy (Estimated Energy Requirements)

**Source:** Health Canada Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)

| Age Group | Formula |
|-----------|---------|
| 0-3 months | `(89 × weight) - 100 + 175` |
| 4-6 months | `(89 × weight) - 100 + 56` |
| 7-12 months | `(89 × weight) - 100 + 22` |
| 13-35 months | `(89 × weight) - 100 + 20` |
| Boys 3-8y | `88.5 - (61.9 × age) + PA × [(26.7 × weight) + (903 × height_m)] + 20` |
| Boys 9-18y | `88.5 - (61.9 × age) + PA × [(26.7 × weight) + (903 × height_m)] + 25` |
| Girls 3-8y | `135.3 - (30.8 × age) + PA × [(10.0 × weight) + (934 × height_m)] + 20` |
| Girls 9-18y | `135.3 - (30.8 × age) + PA × [(10.0 × weight) + (934 × height_m)] + 25` |

**Physical Activity (PA) Coefficients:**
- Sedentary: 1.0
- Low Active: 1.11
- Active: 1.25
- Very Active: 1.48

### Protein

**Source:** Health Canada DRIs (Recommended Dietary Allowance)

| Age Group | g/kg/day |
|-----------|----------|
| 0-6 months | 1.52 |
| 7-12 months | 1.2 |
| 1-3 years | 1.05 |
| 4-8 years | 0.95 |
| 9-13 years | 0.95 |
| 14-18 years | 0.85 |

### Fluid

**Source:** Holliday-Segar Formula (Holliday & Segar, 1957)

| Weight Range | mL/kg/day |
|--------------|-----------|
| First 10 kg | 100 |
| 11-20 kg | 50 |
| >20 kg | 20 |

**Example:** A 25 kg child needs:
- First 10 kg: 10 × 100 = 1,000 mL
- Next 10 kg: 10 × 50 = 500 mL
- Remaining 5 kg: 5 × 20 = 100 mL
- **Total: 1,600 mL/day**

## Validation

This calculator has been validated against:
- Hand calculations using the source formulas
- Baylor College of Medicine Children's BMI & Energy Calculator

**Important:** Always verify critical calculations and use clinical judgment. This tool is intended to assist, not replace, professional assessment.
